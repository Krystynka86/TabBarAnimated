## Description

As part of my journey to refresh my SwiftUI skills, I embarked on an exciting project to create a fully customizable custom tab bar with captivating animations. The goal was to craft an elegant and intuitive user interface that could seamlessly integrate into any SwiftUI-based iOS app.

## Key Features

- **Customizable Tab Bar:** The custom tab bar is designed from the ground up, offering complete flexibility to match the aesthetics and branding of any app. From colors and icons to layout and spacing, each aspect is easily customizable.

- **Stunning Animations:** Animations breathe life into the tab bar, creating a delightful user experience. I leveraged SwiftUI's built-in animation capabilities to add smooth transitions and interactive effects that respond to user interactions.

- **Tab Highlighting:** When users tap on a tab, it gracefully responds with a subtle highlight effect, making the selection feel natural and engaging.

- **Unique Colors for Each Tab:** To give each tab its own personality, I associated a unique color with each tab. The color smoothly blends in and enhances the overall design.

- **Responsive Design:** The tab bar is designed to adapt seamlessly to different device sizes and orientations, ensuring a consistent experience on all iOS devices.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:** Start by cloning the repository to your local machine.

2. **Open in Xcode:** Navigate to the project folder and open the Xcode project.

3. **Run on Simulator/Device:** Build and run the app on the iOS simulator or a physical device running iOS 14.0 or later.
